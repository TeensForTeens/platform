    <h1>ERA Councils: The Three Pillars of an Engaged Constituency</h1>
    <div>
        <h2><span class="fancy">Education:</span> The Council to Foster Political Awareness</h2>
        <p>The Education Council spearheads our efforts to promote civic education. It oversees projects to keep citizens informed about local, state, and national elections and the issues at stake. The Education Council also advises our PAC members on the best ways to raise public awareness of our PAC’s mission and platform goals. The work of this council is paramount to building and maintaining an informed constituency.</p>
    
        <h2><span class="fancy">Representation:</span> The Council to Expand Representation in Government</h2>
        <p>The Representation Council works to bolster the voices of average Americans in government. Too often, politicians lose their accountability to their constituents, believing that their jobs and popularity are secure. This profound lack of political concern leads them to disregard the views of their constituency, silencing the voice of average Americans in policy decisions. The Representation Council works to reverse that trend by making every vote count so that politicians are held accountable; it seeks out opportunities to expand the American people’s voice in politics.</p>
    
        <h2><span class="fancy">Action:</span> The Council to Implement Legislative Strategies</h2>
        <p>The Action Council pioneers strategies to advance legislation that will meaningfully remove obstacles to political involvement. This council focuses primarily on fostering new avenues to advocate for our platform goals at the local, state, and federal levels. The success of that advocacy will have far-reaching effects for political representation and participation in our country.</p>

    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The Unified Democracy Political Action Committee was founded by Benjamin Burstein in February 2015 to encourage increased civic involvement in his home city of Miami Beach, Florida. Originally by the name Teens for Teens, the Unified Democracy PAC played a significant role in helping increase political participation among students in South Florida.</p>
    
        <p>After a year of working with candidates in South Florida, the potential to spread the message of creating a better democracy was working. Voter turnout among young people was increasing, voter registration numbers were at all time highs, and the Unified Democracy PAC quickly became one of the largest political organizations in the country with 105 volunteers contributing over 8,000 hours of their time to candidates supported by the PAC.</p>
    
        <p>The Unified Democracy PAC helped increase voter turnout in numerous local elections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>November 2015 city of Miami election</li>
            <li>November 2015 city of Miami Beach election</li>
            <li>November 2015 city of Hialeah election</li>
            <li>January 2016 Florida City election</li>
            <li>February 2016 city of South Miami election</li>
            <li>March 2016 city of Miami Beach special election</li>
            <li>March 2016 city of Miami referendum</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>In early 2016, the Unified Democracy PAC began its transition to become a national organization. We now have 11 state affiliates under the organization with more than one hundred students working for the PAC.</p>
